# Learn2Grow Email System - Production Setup Guide

## System Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION

The Learn2Grow email system has been successfully migrated from Resend to EmailJS/NodeMailer and is now configured for production use. This means:

1. Emails will be sent directly to actual recipients
2. No more email redirection to test accounts
3. No domain verification required

## How to Complete Setup

To finalize your production email system:

1. **Set up a Gmail Account**
   - Create a dedicated Gmail account for your application
   - Recommended: learn2grow.noreply@gmail.com

2. **Create an App Password**
   - Follow instructions in [GMAIL-APP-PASSWORD.md](./GMAIL-APP-PASSWORD.md)
   - This is required for SMTP authentication with Gmail

3. **Update Your Credentials**
   - Edit the `.env` file with your actual Gmail address and app password:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your_actual_gmail_address@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
   ```

4. **Test the System**
   - Run: `npm run test-email`
   - Verify emails are delivered to actual recipients

## What Will Happen When Users Sign Up

With the current production configuration:

- When a user signs up, they will receive a verification email directly to their inbox
- Admin notifications will be sent to the configured admin email
- Password reset emails will go directly to users' inboxes
- All emails will use the professionally designed HTML templates

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- Check your Gmail sent items to monitor email delivery
- Look for bounce notifications in your Gmail inbox
- If you need to go back to development mode, set `NODE_ENV=development` in your `.env` file
