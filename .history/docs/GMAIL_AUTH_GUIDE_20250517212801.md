# Gmail Authentication Guide for Learn2Grow

We've encountered an authentication error with Gmail. This is expected because Google's security policies require you to use an App Password rather than your regular account password for application access.

## What is an App Password?
An App Password is a 16-character code that gives a non-Google app or device permission to access your Google Account. App Passwords can only be used with accounts that have 2-Step Verification turned on.

## Steps to Create an App Password:

1. Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click on "Security" in the left navigation panel
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select "2-Step Verification" - ensure it's turned ON
4. At the bottom of the page, select "App passwords"
5. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other (Custom name)" as the device
6. Enter "Learn2Grow" as the name
7. Click "Generate"
8. Google will display a 16-character code - copy this code
9. Update your .env file with this code as EMAIL_PASS (without spaces)

## How to Update Your .env File:

```
EMAIL_PASS=your16characterapppassword
```

## Common Issues:

- Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled for your Google account
- If you get "Less secure app access" errors, App Passwords are the solution
- App Passwords don't have spaces when you save them in your configuration
- If you still get errors, check if your organization's Google policy allows SMTP access

## Alternative Solutions:

1. **Use OAuth2 Authentication**: For a more secure approach, you could implement OAuth2 authentication with Gmail. This requires additional setup but provides better security.

2. **Use a Transactional Email Service**: Consider services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES that are specifically designed for sending application emails.

Once you've created an App Password and updated your .env file, run the test email script again to verify it works.
