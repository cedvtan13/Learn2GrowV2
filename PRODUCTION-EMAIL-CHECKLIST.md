# Production Email Configuration Checklist

## System Status: Configured for Production ✅

Your Learn2Grow email system has been configured for production mode. This means emails will be sent directly to recipients without redirection. To complete the setup, follow these steps:

## Required Steps to Complete Setup

1. **Create a Gmail Account for Your Application** ⚠️
   - Create a new Gmail account specifically for your application
   - Use a professional name like learn2grow.noreply@gmail.com
   - Keep this account secure with a strong password

2. **Generate an App Password** ⚠️
   - Follow the instructions in [GMAIL-APP-PASSWORD.md](./GMAIL-APP-PASSWORD.md)
   - Copy the 16-character app password

3. **Update the .env File** ⚠️
   - Open your .env file
   - Replace placeholder values with your actual Gmail address and app password
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your_actual_gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_actual_16_digit_app_password
   ```

4. **Test the Configuration** ⚠️
   - Run the test script: `node test-email-service.js`
   - Verify that emails are being sent without errors
   - Check your inbox for test emails

## Verification Tests

After completing the setup steps above, run these tests:

- [ ] Test password reset flow
- [ ] Test user registration flow 
- [ ] Test admin notification system
- [ ] Verify emails are sent to correct recipients
- [ ] Check email formatting and template rendering

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Email Volume Management**
   - Gmail limits sending to 500 emails per day
   - For higher volume, consider a professional SMTP service like SendGrid or Mailgun

2. **Email Bounce Handling**
   - Monitor your Gmail account for bounce notifications
   - Implement a system to track and handle email delivery failures

3. **Email Authentication**
   - Consider setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your domain
   - This improves deliverability and prevents your emails from being marked as spam

4. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check the application logs regularly for email sending errors
   - Review your Gmail account for any sending limit warnings

## Rollback Plan

If you encounter issues with the production configuration:

1. Set `NODE_ENV=development` in your .env file
2. This will revert to the development mode with email redirection
3. Emails will be saved in the email-logs directory instead of being sent
